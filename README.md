# Plant Disease Detection App

This Flutter project uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to develop a mobile application for plant disease diagnosis. With the app, users can take pictures of plants, which are then analyzed to look for any symptoms of disease. A README.md template is provided below to help you with the documentation creation for your GitHub repository.

# Overview

This Flutter application detects plant diseases by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that has already been trained. With the camera on their mobile, users may take pictures of plants, and the app will use those photos to detect any problems. With the app, users may take preventive steps to prevent crop loss by receiving real-time data on the health status of their plants.

# Features
1. Take pictures of plants with theÂ camera.
2. Using a CNN model that has already been trained, analyze plant photos to detect diseases.
3. Present findings in real time that show the existence and severity of diseases.
4. Offer suggestions for the management or treatment of illnesses that have been identified.
